  A man wanted to enter an exclusive club but did not know the password that was
  required. He waited by the door and listened. A club member knocked on the
  door and the doorman said, "twelve." The member replied, "six " and was let
  in. A second member came to the door and the doorman said, "six." The member
  replied, "three" and was let in. The man thought he had heard enough and
  walked up to the door. The doorman said ,"ten" and the man replied, "five."
  But he was not let in. What should he have said?
